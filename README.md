# correlation_coefficient_calculator uses both Pearson and Spearman ranking method to give the correlation coefficient between two variables. 

The program is purely written with python file and requires that you enter a dictionary with two keys.

Each key should represent each variable say x and y.

each variable should contain iterable with the same length of data (matching data pair)

If the above process is completed you should see the right result of the correlation data.
